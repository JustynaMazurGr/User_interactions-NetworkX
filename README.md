# User_interactions-NetworkX

A and B comment on the same movie 1, which leads to their direct interaction. 
If B and C comment under another video 2, there is also an interaction between them. 
B can tell C about what he learned from A's comment under video 1, which creates an indirect interaction. 
I divide users into groups based on their activity under videos in a given game category. 
I look for the sum of disjoint interaction groups for all game categories.

I used the NetworkX library.
